# Foundations

A research and development framework for recursive intelligence, math-driven reasoning, and high-reliability AI tooling.

Foundations implements the **Foundations Bridge** architectureâ€”unifying math engines, logic kernels, process simulators, and interoperability protocols into a structured environment for building reliable, AI-assisted insight and system design.

## Status
ðŸš§ Active development / architecture consolidation

## Core Focus
- Recursive problem-solving and intelligence modeling  
- Math-based reasoning and proof-driven logic  
- High-reliability AI tooling and process validation  
- System design through canonical structures and simulation

## Architecture (High-Level)
- **Math Engines** â€“ symbolic and numerical computation
- **Logic Kernels** â€“ structured reasoning frameworks
- **Process Simulators** â€“ recursive and cascade-based modeling
- **Interoperability Protocols** â€“ linking modules into unified flows
